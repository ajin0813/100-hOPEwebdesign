			<h2>Homepage coding documentation:</h2>
			<p>The topic of the documentation is to document the process of creating the 100% hOPE website which introduces the organization and allow the potential target users and current users and participants to have access to the latest information (news, charity activities...) of the 100% hOPE. I have recreated most of the parts I designed in the proposal mockup section, but due to some technical limits (which means I don't know how to do it), I have re-designed some part of my website yet still offers similar functions. </p>

      <h3 id ="Key-information"> What I have changed in the Homepage:</h3>
      <ul> 1. I changed the buttons, the initial design was to create a donation button with a heart icon on it, and when you put your mouse on top of it, the heart icon will be flipped so the user knows this button is clickable. Unfortunately, I don't know how to make it flip, so I put shadow underneath the button as the hover animation.</ul>
            <img src="button.png" alt=""><br>
      <ul>2. I deleted the progress bar since I can't recreate it, I can put an image on it but that would be lame for me so I just deleted it. If I ever have to recreate this website in real-life I will ask the java-script guy to fix that for me (if that's a real job out there).</ul>
      <img src="progressbar.png" alt=""><br>
      <ul>3. Changed some layouts so it looks more like the original design in the proposal.</ul>
      <ul>4. Added the form section at the bottom for people to submit their information. </ul>

      			<h2>Donation page coding documentation:</h2>
			<p>For the donation page, I have recreated most of the parts I designed in the proposal mockup section, but due to some technical limits (which means I don't know how to do it), I have re-designed some part of my website yet still offers similar functions. </p>
      <h3 id ="Key-information"> What I have changed in the Donation Page:</h3>
      <p> I have changed the buttons, and deleted the progress bar due to the same reasons I had in homepage, made a hover for the clickable part.</p>
